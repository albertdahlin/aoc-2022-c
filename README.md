# Advent of code 2022

My goal here is to execute all 25 solutions in less than 1 second total time.

- Assume input is correct.
- Only single threaded code.

- [Day 1](src/Day1.c) < 0.1ms
- [Day 2](src/Day2.c) < 0.1ms
- [Day 3](src/Day3.c) < 0.1ms

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
make optimize
```
