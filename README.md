# Advent of code 2022

My goal here is to execute all 25 solutions in less than 1ms total time.

## Assumptions & rules:
- Input must be used as the string is given to you by AOC. No pre-processing allowed.
- Assume input is correct and that it always ends with a new line.
- Result from both part 1 and part 2 must be printed.
- Times are averaged over multiple runs.
- All bets are off when it comes to hardware. Use your quantum computer, ASIC, FPGA, graphics card or whatever fancy thing you have.


## Progress

Here are some timings from my old trusty i7 desktop.

| Day  | Time  |
| ---: | ----: |
|  [1] |  11µs |
|  [2] |   4µs |
|  [3] |  14µs |
|  [4] |  13µs |
|  [5] |   8µs |
|  [6] |   7µs |
|  [7] |  13µs |
|  [8] | 257µs |
|  [9] | 302µs |
| [10] |   1µs |
| Sum  | 629µs |
